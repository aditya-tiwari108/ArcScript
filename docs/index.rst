ArcScript is a simple, indentation-based language designed to make web development faster and more intuitive. It transpiles directly to JavaScript, allowing you to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and write logic with a much cleaner syntax.

This documentation will guide you through all the features of ArcScript, from the basics of variable declaration to advanced DOM manipulation.
